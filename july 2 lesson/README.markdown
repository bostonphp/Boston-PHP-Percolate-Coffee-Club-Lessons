# Boston PHP Percolate Coffee Club
The Percolate Coffee Club is a small group of Boston PHP members that come together at a local coffee shop to learn to code in PHP. Our focus is on learning, and to teach you how to develop web applications and sites using open source technology like PHP.

Join us, RSVP Here: http://www.bostonphp.org

## Lesson 3, July 2, 2011 
In this lesson, we looked at how to design and create a web form and store the results in a database.

## Here is what we learned:
- How to create a database, tables, and fields
- How to link database tables together with foreign keys
- How to create an HTML5 page with fieldset, legend, label, and input
- How to connect to the database
- How to extract data from our database
- Foreach loops, Arrays, Super Globals, Etc
- How to dynamically show the data from the database
- How to collect the data collected from the form and store it in MySQL
- How to redirect the page after the form has been submitted

## Here is what we did step by step:
1. Created a PHP page with just plain HTML, Form, and Form Inputs
2. Created the Database to hold our data
3. Added three tables to hold specific information
4. Added the appropriate fields to each table to hold our data
5. Refactored the PHP page to extract the data and display it as a form
6. Refactored the PHP page to allow it to recieve posted data and store it in a database
7. Refactored the PHP page to redirect the page when user submits the data
8. Testing

> This took us roughly 30 minutes as a team, with me explaining in detail each step.

## Get the code working on your own laptop
1. Make sure you have PHP and MySQL installed and running on your laptop or server
2. Create a database on your MySQL and call it '*workout*'
3. Import the the MySQL SQL file provided here
https://github.com/bostonphp/Boston-PHP-Percolate-Coffee-Club-Lessons/blob/master/july%202%20lesson/sql/workout_2011-07-02.sql
4. Create a folder in your htdocs folder and call it '*lesson3*'
5. Copy the following PHP scripts into this new folder
> https://github.com/bostonphp/Boston-PHP-Percolate-Coffee-Club-Lessons/blob/master/july%202%20lesson/index.php
> https://github.com/bostonphp/Boston-PHP-Percolate-Coffee-Club-Lessons/blob/master/july%202%20lesson/thankyou.php
6. Point your web browser to your htdocs folder like this:
> http://localhost:8888/lesson3/

**Note**: When copying the files locally, you may want to copy as raw from GitHub. Or you can just copy and paste the text and save it as the appropriate filename.

## Homework
Your home assignment is to create another PHP page that shows the data collected from the form.

Here is a mockup of what it shoudl look like:
