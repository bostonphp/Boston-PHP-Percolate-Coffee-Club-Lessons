# Boston PHP Percolate Coffee Club
The Percolate Coffee Club is a small group of Boston PHP members that come together at a local coffee shop to learn to code in PHP. Our focus is on learning, and to teach you how to develop web applications and sites using open source technology like PHP.

## Lesson 3, July 2, 2011 
In this lesson, we looked at how to design and create a web form and store the results in a database.

## Here is what we did step by step
1. Created a PHP page with just plain HTML, Form, and Form Inputs
2. Created the Database to hold our data
3. Added three tables to hold specific information
4. Added the appropriate fields to each table to hold our data
5. Refactored the PHP page to extract the data and display it as a form
6. Refactored the PHP page to allow it to recieve posted data and store it in a database
7. Refactored the PHP page to redirect the page when user submits the data
8. Testing

This took us roughly 30 minutes as a team, with me explaining in detail each step.
