# Boston PHP Percolate Coffee Club
The Percolate Coffee Club is a small group of Boston PHP members that come together at a local coffee shop to learn to code in PHP. Our focus is on learning, and to teach you how to develop web applications and sites using open source technology like PHP.

Each week, we write a PHP program from scratch and each member learns how to do it. Homework is assigned, which is reviewed next time we meet.
